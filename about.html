<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="about-container">
    <pre>
    Our objective is to create something that is both innovative and beneficial to
    individuals, as well as advantageous for our nation.

    Founded in [Year], our mission is to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of our clients. 
    We believe in innovation, integrity, and excellence in every aspect of our business.

    The consumption of junk food is on the rise in contemporary society.
    Many individuals are driven by a desire for flavor, often neglecting to examine the ingredient
    labels or consider the potential long-term effects on their health and life expectancy

    Our project aims to simplify this process by creating an intuitive website that reads food 
    labels and ingredients, providing users with clear insights into the nutritional value of the products 
    they consume With our platform, users can easily upload images of food labels, and in return, 
    they'll receive detailed information about healthy and unhealthy nutrients.
    
    The website will feature graphical representations of nutritional data, a calorie meter to track intake,
    and organized information to help users make informed dietary choices as in our society there is less 
    awareness of food label and Marketing companies also make it more complicated by using unnecessary 
    chemical names like sugar can be written in 73 different forms.
    
    By empowering individuals with knowledge about their food, we aim to promote healthier eating habits 
    and enhance overall well-being.
    
    This project combines technology and nutrition to create a valuable tool for everyone looking to lead a
    healthier lifestyle.</pre>
